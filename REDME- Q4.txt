Analysis and Conclusion for Q4

We created a correlation matrix for all the data, focusing on Manhattan. 
The heatmap indicates a mild correlation between pickups and weather conditions. When 
examining monthly patterns, we discovered a strong positive correlation between pickups 
and warmer weather. In simple terms, as the temperature rises, pickup numbers increase. 
Notably, February, the coldest month, exhibits an inverse correlation with snow depth, 
meaning deeper snow leads to more pickups. In conclusion, some weather conditions may
 lead to an increase or decrease in pickups, however, further analysis is needed with 
 a bigger set of data.
